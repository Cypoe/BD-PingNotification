# PingNotification
BetterDiscord plugin to display in-app notifications. This is a lightweight alternative to "AppNotifications" and isn't meant to be anything super fantastic. 

# **Understanding default operation:**

Out of the box, PingNotification will only work for mentions, DM's and In-line Replies (same as mention).
Upon going into BetterDiscord > Plugins > PingNotification settings > you will see options here to allow what servers should notify **all** messages, regardless of mentions and 'mute' status of the server. You can also block individual User ID's aswell as blocking specific channels. 

# v4.2 Update:
Now properly shows colors of @mentions, @role mentions, etc

# v4.1.1 Update:
Improved pop-up animation

# v4.1.0 Update:
Added settings to change the popup location (Bottom Right, Top Right, Bottom Left, Top Left)
