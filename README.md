A lightweight BetterDiscord plugin to display in-app notifications that focuses on simplicity and efficiency.

## üöÄ Features

- In-app notifications for mentions, DMs, and in-line replies
- Customizable server-specific notifications
- User and channel blocking capabilities
- Privacy mode for content protection

## üîß Default Operation

Out of the box, PingNotification will be in "Automatic" mode which will alert for all messages that you physically here a ping for (aka it follows your discord-level notification settings per guild/channel/user.) 

You have the option to swap to "Manual" mode where you can configure which servers/channels you want to ping for, in manual mode:
- Mentions
- Direct Messages (DMs)
- In-line Replies (same as mention)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Navigate to `BetterDiscord > Plugins > PingNotification settings` to:
- Allow specific servers to notify **all** messages
- Block individual User IDs
- Block specific channels
