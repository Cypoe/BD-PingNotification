# PingNotification
BetterDiscord plugin to display in-app notifications. This is a lightweight alternative to "AppNotifications" and isn't meant to be anything super fantastic. 

# **Understanding default operation:**

Out of the box, PingNotification will only work for mentions, DM's and In-line Replies (same as mention).
Upon going into BetterDiscord > Plugins > PingNotification settings > you will see options here to allow what servers should notify **all** messages, regardless of mentions and 'mute' status of the server. You can also block individual User ID's aswell as blocking specific channels. 

# v5.0 MEGA Update
* Completely rewritten using React for better performance and maintainability
* Fixed issues with custom emoji and bot message rendering

As of right now, there are no known issues.
