# PingNotification
BetterDiscord plugin to display in-app notifications


**Understanding default operation:**
Out of the box, PingNotification will only work for mentions, DM's and In-line Replies (same as mention).
Upon going into BetterDiscord > Plugins > PingNotification settings > you will see options here to allow what servers should notify **all** messages, regardless of pings. You can also block individual User ID's aswell as blocking specific channels.
